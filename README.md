# sqlite-db-manager
A basic SQLite database manager

With this manager you can create, modify, delete SQLite databases and their tables. It supports multi-line commands and inline modify.
For the moment it is localized in italian but I will add even the english language later.

It needs Visual Studio to compile and run it if needed.
